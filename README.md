# CircuitPython ILI9341 Examples

Demo programs to test a 2.8” colour TFT display with the ILI9341 driver with a Raspberry Pi Pico board. 

This Colour TFT display is one of my favourite displays of all time. I have used it in many Arduino projects in the past and I really like it because it is big, inexpensive, it costs around $9, it is easy to use, it also has an SD card slot at the back, and it is a touch screen. 

The display has a resolution of 320x240 pixels and it uses the SPI interface to communicate with the microcontroller. The connection with the Raspberry Pi Pico board is very easy. All we have to do is to connect power and 6 more wires. Watch the video to see how to do it.
